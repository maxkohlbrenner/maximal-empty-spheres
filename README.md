# Maximal Empty Spheres Contouring

Basic code for SDF contouring, as described in our paper [A Polyhedral Construction of Empty Spheres in Discrete Distance Fields](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721238.3730748).

This repository contains two versions of the reconstruction:
- the python implementation used in the paper
- a demo cpp script that uses the CGAL implementation (currently experimental).

For instructions on how to build the cpp version see the Readme in the cgal/ folder.

An example for the application of both versions can be found in the `3D Reconstruction.ipynb` notebook.
